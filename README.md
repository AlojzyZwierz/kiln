An advanced, feature-rich controller for ceramic kilns built on ESP32-WROOM with touchscreen interface and web monitoring capabilities.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Warning
**This is a DIY project. Use at your own risk!** 
Ceramic kilns can be dangerous and may cause fire, electric shock, or property damage. Always implement external safety measures and never leave the kiln unattended during operation. The author takes no responsibility for any damages or injuries.

## ‚ú® Features

### Core Functionality
- **Multi-segment firing programs** - Create complex firing curves with heating, holding, and controlled cooling ramps (default: 25 segments)
- **SPIFFS storage** - Save multiple firing programs with persistent storage
- **Power failure recovery** - Automatically resumes firing after power interruption
- **Hot start capability** - Start firing mid-curve when kiln is already preheated

### Safety & Reliability
- **Multiple safety features** - Temperature limits, error detection, thermal runaway protection
- **PID control** - Custom-written, highly effective PID controller with manual calibration
- **Long-term stability** - Auto-restart after extended runtime to prevent `millis()` overflow
- **Cycle-based power control** - PWM-like control with configurable cycle length to protect mechanical relays

### User Interface
- **Touchscreen interface** - 320x240 color TFT with intuitive controls
- **Edit Circle** - Innovative circular interface for parameter adjustment:
  - Top/Bottom segments: Temperature adjustment
  - Left/Right segments: Time adjustment
  - Distance from center controls adjustment magnitude
- **Real-time graphing** - Live firing curves and progress display
- **Audible feedback** - Interaction sounds, error alerts, startup fanfare, and completion celebration

### Connectivity & Monitoring
- **Web interface** - View firing progress and measurement lists via integrated web server
- **Dual WiFi modes** - Access Point mode or connect to existing WiFi
- **Web configuration** - Set WiFi credentials through web interface

### Advanced Features
- **Energy cost tracking** - Calculate firing costs based on kiln power and energy rates
- **Default bisque firing curve** - Pre-configured for common ceramic needs
- **Extensible design** - Easy to modify and extend

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Requirements

### Main Components
- **ESP32-WROOM** development board
- **TFT Touchscreen** - 320x240 resolution with XPT2046 touch controller
- **MAX31856** - Thermocouple amplifier (supports K, S, B type thermocouples)
- **Solid State Relay (SSR)** - For kiln power control
- **Buzzer** - For audible feedback

### Pin Configuration
```cpp
// TFT Display
TFT_MISO=12, TFT_MOSI=13, TFT_SCLK=14, TFT_CS=15, TFT_DC=2, TFT_RST=4

// MAX31856 Thermocouple
MAX_CS=5, MAX_CLK=18, MAX_MISO=19, MAX_MOSI=23

// Touch Controller (XPT2046)
XPT2046_IRQ=36, XPT2046_MOSI=32, XPT2046_MISO=39, XPT2046_CLK=25, XPT2046_CS=33

// Other
SSR_PIN=16, BUZZERPIN=22
